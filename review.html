		 My agent, Xiuzhen Lu is awesome! Very patient, very careful, and very professional in giving us all truly helpful advices for a satisfactory house purchase!

		Xiuzhen was great! She always texted or called back immediately and made sure we had the option to get out of a contract if 
		unhappy with the house. She was very professional and we were happy to have her as our realtor.

		Ms. Xiuzhen Lu helped us buy the house just like she was buying her own house. She is the one you can trust.

		Xiuzhen Lu is the most excellent agent we have ever had. She is very professional. She fully understands what we need, and she has always provided us 
		with high standard service. From our property location selection to price negotiation, from inspection arrangement to house closing, 
		she has demonstrated her professional skills. She helps us almost 24/7. She has shown us many different properties even during weekends, 
		she has communicated with us in a timely manner. We were extremely impressed by her knowledge for Augusta housing market, the dedication to her customer. 
		We are very grateful for her best service to us.

		Since I moved out of South Carolina several years ago and currently reside in Nevada, so it is very difficult for me to handle my house in Aiken, SC. 
		Ms. Xiuzhen Lu as my agent helped me in many, many ways to prepare for the selling of my house. I appreciate very much for her professional work and help.

		Lu was amazing through the entire process-very friendly and caring person I miss her already. She is an example of what a sales person is and I want to have many of her attributes when I get my sales career. 
		It paid off.

	<p style="background-color:green;color:white;font-size:23px;"> 
		Though as a young man this is my only experience of purchasing real estate property, I can certainly say this dealing experience is and will be the best. 
		You can never over applaud Ms Xiuzhen Lu as an exceptional real agent and as a sincere friend. She is immensely knowledgeable in local real estate market, 
		exceedingly considerate to your needs and expectation, extraordinarily 
		patient in the tedious dealing process. I would recommend her to every one of my friends who want to purchase or sell real estate property at CSRA.
